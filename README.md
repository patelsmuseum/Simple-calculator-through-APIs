# Simple-calculator-through-APIs

# About
Created a set of APIs for the following mathematical arithmetic operations.

- ## [Divide API](https://6bmchy0x1i.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/divide?num1=45&num2=9)
  The API endpoint for the division operation is:
     https://6bmchy0x1i.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/divide
  ### How to use
       * To use the API, make a `GET` request to the endpoint with the two numbers you want to divide as query parameters.
   
            For example:    https://6bmchy0x1i.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/divide?num1=45&num2=9
  
   In this example, `num1` is 45, and `num2` is 9. Replace these values with the numbers you want to divide.


  - ## [Multiply API](https://b7uuumaa54.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/multiply?num1=45&num2=3)
  The API endpoint for the Multiplication operation is:
     https://b7uuumaa54.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/multiply
  ### How to use
       * To use the API, make a `GET` request to the endpoint with the two numbers you want to multiply as query parameters.
   
            For example:    https://b7uuumaa54.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/multiply?num1=45&num2=3
  
   In this example, `num1` is 45, and `num2` is 3. Replace these values with the numbers you want to Multiply.


- ## [Subtract API](https://v59montpna.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/sub?num1=58&num2=12)
  The API endpoint for the Subtract operation is:
     https://v59montpna.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/sub
  ### How to use
       * To use the API, make a `GET` request to the endpoint with the two numbers you want to subtract as query parameters.
   
            For example:    https://v59montpna.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/sub?num1=58&num2=12
  
   In this example, `num1` is 58, and `num2` is 12. Replace these values with the numbers you want to Subtract.

- ## [Add API](https://jxubr74rjh.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/add?num1=12&num2=56)
  The API endpoint for the Add operation is:
     https://jxubr74rjh.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/add
  ### How to use
       * To use the API, make a `GET` request to the endpoint with the two numbers you want to Add as query parameters.
   
            For example:    https://jxubr74rjh.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/add?num1=12&num2=56
  
   In this example, `num1` is 12, and `num2` is 56. Replace these values with the numbers you want to add.
